# MongoDB and Mongo Express Helm Chart

## Overview

This Helm chart simplifies the deployment of MongoDB and Mongo Express on a Kubernetes cluster. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and Mongo Express is a web-based administration interface for managing MongoDB databases.

This chart provides an easy way to set up a MongoDB instance with authentication and a Mongo Express interface for database management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- Helm installed on your local machine and configured to work with your Kubernetes cluster.
